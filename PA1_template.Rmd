This program requires the following packages:lattice, ggplot2, and lubridate
```{r}
library(lattice)
library(ggplot2)
library(lubridate)
```
Load the data that is already tidy
```{r echo = TRUE}
userData <- read.csv("activity.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
```
#What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day
Calculate the total number of steps taken per day
Also, add a column for the day of the week
```{r, echo=TRUE, plot1, fig.height=4}
userData$weekday <- weekdays(as.Date(userData$date))
userData$weekday <- as.factor(userData$weekday)
stepsByDay <- aggregate(userData$steps, list(userData$date), FUN = sum)
colnames(stepsByDay) <- c("date", "steps")
barplot(stepsByDay$steps, names.arg = stepsByDay$Date, xlab = "date", ylab = "steps")
```

##Calculate and report the mean and median of the total number of steps taken per day
```{r, echo=TRUE}
meanStepsPerDay <- mean(stepsByDay$steps, na.rm=TRUE)
medianStepsPerDay <- median(stepsByDay$steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```
#What is the average daily activity pattern?
Make a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") of the 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all days (y-axis)
Which 5-minute interval, on average across all the days in the dataset, contains the maximum number of steps?
```{r, echo=TRUE, plot2, fig.height=4}
intervalSteps <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data = userData, FUN = mean)
plot(intervalSteps, type="l")
intervalSteps$interval[which.max(intervalSteps$steps)]
```
#Imputing missing values
Calculate and report the total number of missing values in the dataset
Devise a strategy for filling in all of the missing values in the dataset. The strategy is not sophisticated. I use the interval's mean. This is because most NA's occur on the same day.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
sum(is.na(userData$steps))
newSet <- merge(x=userData, y=intervalSteps, by="interval")
blankRows <- is.na(newSet$steps.x)
newSet$steps.x[blankRows] <- newSet$steps.y[blankRows]
```
##Make a histogram of the total number of steps taken each day.
Calculate and report the mean and median total number of steps taken per day. 
```{r, echo=TRUE, plot3, fig.height=4}
stepsDay <- aggregate(steps.x ~ date, data = newSet, FUN = sum)
barplot(stepsDay$steps, names.arg = stepsDay$Date, xlab = "date", ylab = "steps")
mean(stepsDay$steps, na.rm=TRUE)
median(stepsDay$steps, na.rm=TRUE)
```
These values do not differ much from our first estimates--the impact is minimal.

#Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
Create a new factor variable in the dataset with two levels – “weekday” and “weekend” indicating whether a given date is a weekday or weekend day.
```{r, echo=TRUE}
categorizeDay <- function(day) {
  if (day %in% c("Saturday", "Sunday")) {
    "weekend"
  }else{
    "weekday"
  }}
newSet$daytype <- as.factor(sapply(newSet$weekday, categorizeDay))
```
##Make a panel plot containing a time series plot (i.e. type = "l") ofthe 5-minute interval (x-axis) and the average number of steps taken, averaged across all weekday days or weekend days (y-axis).
```{r, echo=TRUE, plot4, fig.height=4}
xyplot(steps.x ~ interval | daytype, data=newSet, type="l", xlab="Interval", ylab="Steps", main="Weekend vs. Weekday Steps", layout=c(1,2))
```

It appears that the user is more active on weekday mornings. On weekends, the user is slightly more active in the afternoons.
